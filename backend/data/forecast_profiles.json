During active months, the state averages 6.1 declarations per month. Activity peaks in July, December, and October, with the highest-risk window being July\u2013December.\n\n6-Year Forecast (model CV MAE=0.54):\nOur Prophet time series model projects severe storm declaration frequency in Vermont through February 2032. During forecasted peak months (July, December, October), the model predicts an average of 1.1 declarations/month. During off-season months, activity is expected to remain near 0.3 declarations/month.\n\nWorkforce Impact:\nIndustries most affected by severe storm declarations in Vermont include agriculture, construction, utilities, and outdoor industries. Workers and employers in Vermont should anticipate potential workforce disruption during July\u2013December. Disaster declaration frequency is seasonal \u2014 some years may see significantly more or fewer events depending on weather patterns.\n\nImportant note: These forecasts predict FEMA declaration frequency (how often disasters are formally declared), not disaster probability or severity. A single major event can generate many county-level declarations in one month.",
