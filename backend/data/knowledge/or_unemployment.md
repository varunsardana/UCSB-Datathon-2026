## Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA)
- Oregon has significant wildfire, flood, and severe storm disaster history — DUA is frequently activated
- Triggered when Oregon receives a presidential major disaster declaration
- Covers self-employed workers, agricultural workers, and those ineligible for regular UI
- Apply through OED within 30 days of DUA announcement
- OED sets up wildfire-specific guidance — check unemployment.oregon.gov after any major fire declaration

## Oregon-Specific: Wildfire Context
- Oregon wildfires frequently trigger DUA for workers in affected counties (e.g., Jackson, Klamath, Douglas counties)
- Workers who had to evacuate and could not report to work may qualify even without formal layoff
- Self-employed workers (farmers, contractors, guides) hit hard by wildfire are explicitly covered under DUA

## Work Search Requirements
- Must make at least 3 job contacts per week
- Log contacts in Frances Online
- Work search is routinely waived for counties under wildfire and flood disaster declarations
