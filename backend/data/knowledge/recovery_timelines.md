# Disaster Workforce Recovery Timelines

## How Long Does Recovery Take? (Based on Historical Data)

Recovery is not a single event — it's a curve with distinct phases. Timing varies by disaster type, severity, regional economy, and federal response speed.

## Wildfire Recovery Timeline

### Phase 1: Immediate (Days 1-14)
- Emergency responders, utilities, and healthcare at maximum demand
- Hospitality, retail, entertainment: immediate closures (30-60% of businesses)
- Most non-essential businesses closed in evacuation zones

### Phase 2: Stabilization (Weeks 2-8)
- Insurance adjusters and claims processors: very high demand
- Debris removal crews deployed; construction supply chains activated
- Mental health workers and social services see increased load
- Retail and hospitality begin reopening outside direct impact areas

### Phase 3: Recovery (Months 2-6)
- Construction and rebuilding at peak demand (+150-300% above baseline)
- Environmental remediation (hazmat, erosion control, landscaping) ramps up
- Entertainment and tourism recovery begins, but remains subdued
- Many displaced workers find new employment (often in construction/services)

### Phase 4: Normalization (Months 6-18+)
- Housing reconstruction drives sustained construction demand
- Insurance and legal professions remain elevated
- Some affected businesses never reopen (10-30% permanent closures in severe fires)
- Economic recovery varies significantly by income level of affected area

## Hurricane Recovery Timeline

### Phase 1: Immediate Response (Days 1-21)
- Emergency services, utilities, healthcare surge
- Supply chains disrupted; logistics/transport workers in high demand
- Mass evacuations create temporary labor shortages everywhere

### Phase 2: Return and Assessment (Weeks 3-8)
- Insurance adjusters overwhelmed — very high-paying, high-demand role
- Structural engineers and inspectors needed before rebuilding can start
- FEMA case managers and DUA processors hired in large numbers

### Phase 3: Rebuilding (Months 2-18)
- Construction is the dominant sector: roofing, electrical, plumbing, HVAC
- Skilled trades wages typically 20-40% above normal during this period
- Commercial real estate recovery lags residential by 3-6 months
- Hospitality and tourism in flood zones: 12-24 months to full recovery

### Phase 4: Long-term Recovery (Years 1-5)
- Major disasters (Katrina-level) can permanently reshape regional labor markets
- Out-migration of workers is significant — labor supply may not fully return
- Community development and government jobs expand significantly in recovery phase

## Flood Recovery Timeline

### Phase 1 (Days 1-30)
- Water remediation companies at maximum capacity
- Mold remediation and drying services surge
- Electrical and plumbing contractors needed as soon as water recedes

### Phase 2 (Months 1-6)
- Drywall, flooring, and interior renovation industries boom
- Insurance claims: 6-18 months to fully process in large floods
- Schools and government services may be relocated; education sector disrupted

## Earthquake Recovery Timeline

### Phase 1 (Days 1-14)
- Search and rescue, medical surge
- Utilities (gas, electric, water) repair is critical — crews from other states fly in

### Phase 2 (Weeks 2-12)
- Structural engineers inspect every building before occupancy
- Retrofit and repair construction starts immediately after inspections
- Mental health demand rises significantly (PTSD is prevalent post-earthquake)

### Phase 3 (Months 3-36)
- Full rebuilding may take years for heavily damaged areas
- Tech and office sectors recover quickly if infrastructure is intact
- Small businesses in older buildings face the longest recovery

## Key Insight: The "Labor Gap Window"
The most critical period for displaced workers is months 2-6 post-disaster. By then:
- Emergency jobs are winding down
- Rebuilding jobs are ramping up but require different skills
- Unemployment benefits may start expiring for early filers
- Workers who retrain in this window have the best outcomes

Training programs entered in month 2-3 can position workers for the construction/trades surge at months 4-12.
