# COBRA Health Insurance Continuation

## What Is COBRA?
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) allows workers who lose their jobs to continue their employer-sponsored health insurance for a limited period.

## Who Qualifies?
- You worked for an employer with 20 or more employees
- You had group health plan coverage through your employer
- You experienced a "qualifying event": involuntary termination (layoffs count), reduction in hours, or certain other events

## How Long Can You Keep Coverage?
- **Layoff or termination** (not for gross misconduct): Up to 18 months
- **Reduction in hours below full-time**: Up to 18 months
- **Employee death or divorce from covered employee**: Up to 36 months for dependents

## What Does It Cost?
- You pay the **full premium** — both your share and your employer's share — plus a 2% administrative fee
- Typical cost: $500-$800/month for an individual; $1,400-$2,200/month for a family
- COBRA is expensive because your employer is no longer contributing

## How to Elect COBRA
1. Your employer must notify the health plan administrator within 30 days of the qualifying event
2. The plan administrator has 14 days to send you an election notice
3. You have **60 days** to elect COBRA coverage from the date of the notice
4. Once elected, you have **45 days** to make your first premium payment
5. Coverage is retroactive — if you need care before electing, you can still elect and pay retroactively

## Alternatives to COBRA
Because COBRA is expensive, consider these alternatives:

### ACA Marketplace (Healthcare.gov)
- Job loss qualifies as a Special Enrollment Period (60 days to enroll)
- Subsidies available based on income — many displaced workers qualify for significant subsidies
- Visit healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596
- If your income drops below 250% FPL, you may qualify for very low or no-cost coverage

### Medicaid / Medi-Cal (California)
- If your income drops significantly after a disaster, you may suddenly qualify
- No enrollment period restriction — you can apply any time
- California: Apply at Covered California (coveredca.gov) or county social services
- Federal: medicaid.gov

### Spouse's or Parent's Plan
- Losing job coverage is a qualifying event for adding yourself to another plan
- Contact the other plan within 30 or 60 days (varies by plan)

## Disaster Context
During and after declared disasters:
- Some insurers waive prior authorization requirements in disaster zones
- FEMA's Individuals and Households Program (IHP) may cover some medical costs not covered by insurance
- Many hospitals in disaster areas operate under "crisis standards of care" and may defer or reduce billing
