# WARN Act — Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification

## What Is the WARN Act?
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act is a federal law (29 U.S.C. § 2101) that requires employers to give advance notice before mass layoffs or plant closings.

## Who Is Covered?
The WARN Act applies to employers with:
- **100 or more full-time employees**, OR
- 100 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per week

Self-employed individuals, federal government employees, and workers employed less than 6 months are typically excluded.

## When Notice Is Required
Employers must give 60 days advance written notice before:
- A **plant closing** that affects 50 or more employees at a single site
- A **mass layoff** affecting 500+ employees OR 50-499 employees if they make up 1/3 of the workforce at the site
- A **relocation** of all or substantially all operations more than 100 miles away

## Exceptions to the 60-Day Rule
- **Faltering company**: Employer was actively seeking capital and giving notice would have undermined the search
- **Unforeseeable business circumstances**: Sudden, dramatic business situation (a disaster could qualify)
- **Natural disaster**: The plant closing or mass layoff was caused directly by a natural disaster

## What Employers Must Provide
If WARN applies, employers must provide:
- 60 days written notice to each affected employee
- Notice to the chief elected official of the local government
- Notice to the state dislocated worker unit

## If WARN Is Violated
Employers who fail to give proper notice are liable for:
- **Back pay**: Up to 60 days of wages and benefits per employee
- **Civil penalties**: Up to $500 per day of violation
- Employees can sue in federal court

## State Mini-WARN Laws
Many states have their own laws with stricter requirements:
- **California (Cal-WARN)**: Applies to employers with 75+ employees; 60-day notice for layoffs of 50+ workers; also covers relocations
- **New York (NY WARN)**: Applies to 50+ employees; 90-day notice required
- **Illinois**: 75+ employees; 60-day notice for 25+ workers
- **New Jersey**: 100+ employees; 60-day notice; also requires severance pay
- **Florida**: No state mini-WARN law; federal WARN only

## Practical Advice for Workers
1. Ask your HR department if WARN applies to your situation
2. If you suspect a WARN violation, contact the Department of Labor: 1-866-4-USA-DOL
3. You may also consult an employment attorney — many offer free initial consultations
4. WARN notice gives you 60 days to prepare: update resume, apply for unemployment, consult benefits
