# National Unemployment Insurance Guide — All States

This guide applies to all US states and territories not covered by a state-specific file,
and provides universal information that supplements all state-specific guides.

## How Unemployment Insurance Works (Universal)

Unemployment Insurance (UI) is a federal-state partnership. Every state runs its own program
under federal guidelines. The process is similar everywhere:

1. **You lose your job through no fault of your own** (layoff, business closure, disaster)
2. **You file a claim** with your state's unemployment agency (online is fastest)
3. **One-week waiting period** (most states) before your first payment
4. **You certify weekly or bi-weekly** — confirm you're still unemployed and looking for work
5. **You receive weekly payments** for up to 26 weeks (most states; some allow 20 or 30)

**Rule of thumb**: File within the first week after job loss. Delays cost you money — most
states don't pay retroactively for weeks you waited to file.

## Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) — How It Works Everywhere

DUA is a federal program that kicks in after a presidential major disaster declaration.
It covers workers who **don't qualify** for regular state UI:

- Self-employed individuals (sole proprietors, gig workers, freelancers, farmers)
- Agricultural workers
- Workers who lost their jobs because of the disaster even if they normally wouldn't qualify
- People whose places of employment were damaged or destroyed

**How to apply for DUA:**
1. Wait for your governor to request (and FEMA to approve) a disaster declaration
2. Your state's unemployment agency will announce DUA availability
3. Apply through your **state's** unemployment agency (same agency as regular UI)
4. Apply within **30 days** of the DUA announcement date — this deadline is firm
5. FEMA's disaster assistance site: disasterassistance.gov (also tracks DUA availability by state)

**DUA vs. regular UI:** DUA typically pays the same weekly amount as state UI minimum,
and lasts for the duration of the disaster period (usually 13–26 weeks).

## Filing Tips That Apply in Every State

1. **File immediately** — don't wait. Most states pay from the week you file, not when you lost your job.
2. **File online** — phone lines are overwhelmed after disasters; online portals are faster and 24/7.
3. **Gather before you file**: Social Security number, employer name/address, last day of work, reason for separation.
4. **Certify on time** — missing a certification week means missing that week's payment. It usually can't be recovered.
5. **Report part-time earnings** — if you take a part-time job during your claim, report the income. Your benefit is reduced but not eliminated. Hiding income is fraud.
6. **DUA deadline is firm** — the 30-day DUA application window does not extend. If you think you might qualify, apply even if unsure.
