# Transferable Skills Guide — Disaster Workforce Transitions

**Pivot to these post-disaster roles:**
- **Insurance Claims Processing**: High demand after disasters; customer service + documentation skills apply; 4-8 week licensing prep

- **Healthcare Patient Services**: Medical receptionist, patient intake — customer service is directly applicable
- **Call Center / Customer Support**: Businesses process high claim volumes post-disaster; remote work often available
- **Courier / Delivery (last mile)**: High demand during recovery; app-based gig work (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Amazon Flex) as bridge income
